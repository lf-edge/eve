## List of commercial adopters (in alphabetical order)

Some of the referenced documentation below has specific mentions of Project EVE and EVE-OS, but all of these adopters rely on the Project EVE for the edge computing deployment (and on the ZEDEDA commercial controller for management and orchestration). Furthermore, the EVE-OS which is used comes directly from LF Edge, whether docker pulled from lfedge/eve:$VERSION (as described in <https://help.zededa.com/hc/en-us/articles/27589207303451-Get-EVE-OS>), or installed directly from <https://github.com/lf-edge/eve/releases/> (as described in <https://help.zededa.com/hc/en-us/articles/22287949181467-PXE-server-setup#h_01HMSZWE0Y2C16YSNN490WRMA7>). Thus the use of ZEDEDA here implies direct and unmodified usage of the output of Project EVE.
