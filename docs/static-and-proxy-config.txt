When the device boots it determines the set of network interfaces.
By default this is determined by extracting the manufacturer and model
strings from dmidecode; /opt/zededa/bin/hardwaremodel does this determination.

That model string is used to look up a json file in /var/tmp/zededa/DeviceNetworkConfig/
If no such json file is found the device uses /var/tmp/zededa/DeviceNetworkConfig/default.json

Those files merely specify the set of management ports, plus which of them
do not have per usage charging (to separate out LTE modems).
The default.json is:
{
    "Uplink":["eth0","wlan0","wwan0"],
    "FreeUplinks":["eth0","wlan0"]
}
Note that this uses the old "uplink" terminology; new terminology is
"management port".

This per-model comfiguration can be overridden by an optional file in
/config which is added when the image is built/installed.
That file is /config/DevicePortConfig/override.json
[Note that this file does not override cloud configuration. TBD: should we rename
it to local.json instead?]

That file can specify multiple management interfaces, and can specify static IP
and DNS configuration (for environments where DHCP is not used). In addition it
can specify proxies using different mechanism.

An example file to specify using WPAD to retrieve proxy configuration on eth0 is:
{
    "Version": 1,
    "Ports": [
        {
            "AddrSubnet": "",
            "Dhcp": 4,
            "DnsServers": null,
            "DomainName": "",
            "Exceptions": "",
            "Free": true,
            "Gateway": "",
            "IfName": "eth0",
            "IsMgmt": true,
            "NetworkProxyEnable": true,
            "NetworkProxyURL": "",
            "NtpServer": "",
            "Pacfile": "",
            "Proxies": null
        }
    ]
}

To specify fetching from a fixed WPAD URL one would set:
            "NetworkProxyEnable": true,
            "NetworkProxyURL": "http://wpad.sc.zededa.net/wpad.dat",

To specify a particular set of http and https proxies with a set of
exceptions one would set TBD
            "Proxies": [ { "Server": "proxy.example.com", "Port":1080, "Type":1 },
                       { "Server": "proxy.example.com", "Port":1080, "Type":0 } ],
            "Exceptions": "example.com",


To specify a PAC file inline one would base64 encode the PAC file and set the
result as the Pacfile e.g.,
	Pacfile":"ZnVuY3Rpb24gRmluZFByb3h5Rm9yVVJMKHVybCxob3N0KSB7CmlmIChob3N0ID09ICIxMjcuMC4wLjEiKSB7cmV0dXJuICJESVJFQ1QiO30KaWYgKGhvc3QgPT0gImxvY2FsaG9zdCIpIHtyZXR1cm4gIkRJUkVDVCI7fQppZiAoaXNQbGFpbkhvc3ROYW1lKGhvc3QpKSB7cmV0dXJuICJESVJFQ1QiO30KZWxzZSB7IHJldHVybiAiUFJPWFkgcHJveHkucHJpdi5zYy56ZWRlZGEubmV0OjEwODAiO30KfQo=",


An example file with eth0 being static and eth1 using dhcp is:
{
    "Version": 1,
    "Ports": [
        {
            "AddrSubnet": "38.108.181.238/24", 
            "Dhcp": 1,
            "DnsServers": [
                "8.8.8.8"
            ],
            "DomainName": "example.com",
            "Free": true,
            "Gateway": "38.108.181.254",
            "IfName": "eth0",
            "IsMgmt": true,
            "NtpServer": "38.108.181.254",
            "NetworkProxyEnable": false,
            "NetworkProxyURL": "",
            "NtpServer": "",
            "Pacfile": "",
            "Proxies": null
        },
        {
            "Dhcp": 4,
            "Free": true,
            "IfName": "eth1",
            "IsMgmt": true
        }
    ]
}

If you want eth1 to be configured by zedrouter and used by applications but not
used for zedcloud management traffic, make sure you have Version 1 and IsMgmt false.

NOTE that if a static IP configuration is used with WPAD DNS discovery then the
DomainName needs to be set; the DomainName is used to determine where to look for
the wpad.dat file. Alternatively, an explicit NetworkProxyURL can be set.
The logic for how the device looks for the URL based on the DomainName is specified
in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Proxy_Auto-Discovery_Protocol
The device does not specify DHCP-based WPAD since most browsers do not.

In addition the above configurations be specified from the EV-controller by
specifying one or more networks with the proxy and/or static as part of the
zcli device create.

Troubleshooting
===============

The blinking pattern can be extracted from the shell using
cat /var/tmp/ledmanager/config/ledconfig.json

If the device does not have any usable IP addresses it will be 1,
if IP address but no cloud connectivity it will be 2,
if the cloud responds (even if it is an http error e.g, if the device is not yet
onboarded), it will be 3, and if a GET of /config works it will be 4.

One can test proxy connectivity to zedcloud using
    /opt/zededa/bin/client -s ping
or
    /opt/zededa/bin/client -s -r 5 ping
to try at most 5 times.

And to try other URLs one can do
	/opt/zededa/bin/client -s -r 5 -U http://www.google.com ping
	/opt/zededa/bin/client -s -r 5 -U https://www.google.com -I ping
(-I disables the certificate chain check against /config/root-certificate.pem)

The logs for the onboarding attempts are in
    /persist/`zboot curpart`/log/client.log

If there are no IP addresses, the logs for network interface manager can help:
    /persist/`zboot curpart`/log/nim.log

Finally zedagent.log, downloader.log, and /persist/log/logmanager.log will contain
errors if those agents can not reach zedcloud.
