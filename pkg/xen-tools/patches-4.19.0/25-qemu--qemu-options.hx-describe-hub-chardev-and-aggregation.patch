This adds a few lines describing `hub` aggregator configuration
for aggregation of several backend devices with a single frontend
device.

+``-chardev hub,id=id,chardevs.0=id[,chardevs.N=id]``
+    Explicitly create chardev backend hub device with the possibility
+    to aggregate input from multiple backend devices and forward it to
+    a single frontend device. Additionally, ``hub`` device takes the
+    output from the frontend device and sends it back to all the
+    connected backend devices. This allows for seamless interaction
+    between different backend devices and a single frontend
+    interface. Aggregation supported for up to 4 chardev
+    devices. (Since 10.0)
+
+    For example, the following is a use case of 2 backend devices:
+    virtual console ``vc0`` and a pseudo TTY ``pty0`` connected to
+    a single virtio hvc console frontend device with a hub ``hub0``
+    help. Virtual console renders text to an image, which can be
+    shared over the VNC protocol. In turn, pty backend provides
+    bidirectional communication to the virtio hvc console over the
+    pseudo TTY file. The example configuration can be as follows:
+
+    ::
+
+       -chardev pty,path=/tmp/pty,id=pty0 \
+       -chardev vc,id=vc0 \
+       -chardev hub,id=hub0,chardevs.0=pty0,chardevs.1=vc0 \
+       -device virtconsole,chardev=hub0 \
+       -vnc 0.0.0.0:0
+
+    Once QEMU starts VNC client and any TTY emulator can be used to
+    control a single hvc console:
+
+    ::
+
+       # Start TTY emulator
+       tio /tmp/pty
+
+       # Start VNC client and switch to virtual console Ctrl-Alt-2
+       vncviewer :0
+
+    Several frontend devices is not supported. Stacking of multiplexers
+    and hub devices is not supported as well.
+
 ``-chardev vc,id=id[[,width=width][,height=height]][[,cols=cols][,rows=rows]]``
     Connect to a QEMU text console. ``vc`` may optionally be given a
     specific size.
